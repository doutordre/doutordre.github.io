Hello! I'm Andre and I work as an electronics engineer for an audio technology company. 

I've been recently challenged to create a blog type page so I have a place where I can dump my personal research findings. I really liked this idea as it wouldn't be yet another Word document or A5 notebook forgotten in my office. No... instead it would be cluttering the Internet alongside all the redundant information! 

I will be posting links to educational resources or notes that Iâ€™ve taken and make comments on what I understood and my plans for the next step of the journey. Hopefully this will help structure my learning, keep me motivated and then serve as somewhere I can reference to later on.

Welcome to my study blog.
