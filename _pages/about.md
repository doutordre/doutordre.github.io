Hello! I'm Andre and I work as an electronics engineer for an audio technology company. 

I've been recently challenged to create a blog type page so I have a place where I can dump my personal research findings. I really liked this idea as it wouldn't be yet another Word document or A5 notebook which would catch dust in my office or computer. No... instead it would clutter the Internet with more redundant information! 

I will post links to educational resources or notes that Iâ€™ve taken and make comments on what I understood and my plans for the next step of the journey. Hopefully this will help structure my learnings and have some place I can reference to later on.

Welcome to my study blog.
