Was the comment that Marc, my manager, left on one of my workplace performance Goals which promped me to actually start one. I guess my chronic inertia is only beaten when my livelihood is on the line...

I've been always interested in writing and communicating but for some reason I have developed a shy demeanor and a phobia to leave a digital footprint which stopped me to find the courage to actually start one. It seems that now it's time to take steps to work on that.

This blog will be a safe space where I'll practice my writen communication, documentation and blogging skills. Maybe after I get more confortable to speak, or better yet, write my mind I'll create a another personal blog.

It will be a repository for my findings as I research the disciplines I have mentioned in the myFocus (our performance review system) goal ["Get knowledge in fields/tools relevant for my career growth"][goal] (private page). I will post links to educational resources or notes that I've taken and make comments on what I understood and my plans for the next step of the journey. It will act as a way to objectively track my progress for this goal. 

This is it for the moment. Next entry I'll explain why I chose this particular blogging platform.
