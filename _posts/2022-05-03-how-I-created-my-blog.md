This one covers my journey to start this particular blog.<!--more-->

After getting my mind set on writing my findings on an online platform, I started by doing a couple of web searches: "personal blog" and "how to start a free blog".

Answering these queries, I received some lists with "the best blogging platforms" and also some "how to"'s but all of them in Wordpress. I do recall seeing Wordpress plastered in every blog I visited a while ago, but the guides seemed overly complicated for what I wanted and all of them seemed to focus on maximizing the revenue from the blogs, including the recommended alternative platforms. This is very much in line with the trend of hyperfinantialization of content and user data on the Internet. It's interesting to see how it's more difficult to find information for a simple goal as mine than on making a whole business around it.

In any case, this general approach wasn't very fruitful. I decided on defining the requirements for my blog: I wanted a minimalist online notebook where I could quickly write entries, without too much account management and with simple archival tools. A live journal of sorts but without comment boxes or audience interaction. 

This reminded me that I used to read some posts on LiveJournal 15 years ago. However I found out later that this platform had social media elements, not to my liking. My next step was what I usually do, search social media websites. When looking for "free minimalist blog reddit" I found a [thread on a web design group](https://old.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/6hxaw8/tips_for_creating_a_minimalist_blog_without_using/) where the top recommendation was **Jekyll**. Interestingly there was a Python based framework, Django, which at first seemed atractive as, from my Python experience, I was sure it would be straightforward, as minimalist or complex I wanted but I couldn't even start to wrap my head around deploying a blog with Python so I skipped it. Some of the platforms I found on my first few queries were also mentioned, which were a definite pass. 

The thread had many useful tips but the conversations were specific to their domain and heavy on jargon which, given my humble objectives, put me off pursuing them further. In any case I did find a link to this [hilarious page](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com) (very mature language). I do agree with the spirit of the website's critique, as sometimes I do wish the Internet to be a bit more simplified and less polluted with noise.

Finally it came to my mind I've read really simple looking development blogs hosted on Github. I already had a github account so I made the final search query "start blog on github" whose second entry seemed to be what [I was looking for](https://www.foxinfotech.in/2019/12/how-to-create-a-blog-using-github-pages-and-jekyll-with-a-few-clicks.html). It was a five step guide one of them being creating a github account and, ironically, it was how I found out that Jekyll is used to power and customise Github blogs. After spending a little time looking for a look I wanted (although I may change later on) I followed the steps in the guide and made my first post where I tested some of the Markdown syntax and the Jekyll theme functions.

I guess that concludes my retelling of the steps I've taken to get this thing live. I'm looking forward to write a little bit about my little dip into the embedded Rust world. In case I don't, I have a course on design for EMI next week which will most definitely be covered on a blog post soon.

Til then
