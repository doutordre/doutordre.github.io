Computer networks is a subject which have eluded me and I never had much interest in them. 
In the past, I've built my home network and the network of my parent's business but always following online guidance. 
I understood its building blocks as an electrical circuit but what happens from the ISP provided router onwards and how it works is something I don't understand.
Recently I had trouble understanding a conversation with a colleague while working on a project that uses an ethernet bridge as an interface. 
It made me realize that it would be useful to have a grasp on the basics to at least have some understanding in the jargon used.

As I didn't know where to start, I asked colleagues for advice on good references on the subject. 
I was told that the industry standard are the CompTIA IT certification courses.
I found that CompTIA had the [Network+ certification] (https://www.comptia.org/certifications/network#overview) which seemed to be exactly what I was looking for. 
I was only interested in bits of the [syllabus](https://www.edusum.com/comptia/comptia-network-plus-n-plus-exam-syllabus) so I decided to look for online courses rather than take a full physical course and exam, which are very expesive.
It came to mind that when LinkedIn Learning was introduced in the company, they had tons of courses related to software and IT - unfortunately more so than electronics design, signal processing and all that good stuff I'm interested in - so I had a browse over there.
To my surprise when searching for CompTIA N+ [a particular series](https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?account=2201337&forceAccount=false&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Fcomptia-network-plus-n10-008-cert-prep-1-understanding-networks%3Ftrk%3Dshare_ent_url%26shareId%3D7eIUKaDmQ9K9q09XfF88%252Fw%253D%253D), that covered the exam preparation for it, popped up.
